# fractal-hash-traversal
An implementation of [Jakobsson's Fractal Hash Sequence Traversal algorithm](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/001.pdf).

There is at least one [hash traversal algorithm that is more efficient](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/023.pdf), but this algorithm is simple and relatively easy to implement.

## TODO
 - [x] Create initial tests and pebble generation code
 - [ ] Implement chain traversal given the generated pebbles
 - [ ] Simple tests to check for correctness
